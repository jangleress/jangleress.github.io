## Oceans sustain us

> Our oceans produce 50% of the oxygen we breathe, and are the main source of food for 2.9 billion people

The world depends on healthy oceans. Our oceans produce 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe, and are the main source of food for 2.9 billion people around the world. Oceans also protect us from the effects of climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide produced by human activities. Healthy coasts provide protection to infrastructure and communities from storms and other extreme weather events. The oceans are also economic highways, with ships transporting 90 per cent of global trade. Other industries, such as fishing, provide livelihoods for many coastal communities.

> Nearly 7,500 Canadian communities depend on the oceans for employment

Canada’s oceans support our communities and economy from coast to coast to coast. The oceans contribute $36 billion to our GDP, and nearly 7,500 Canadian communities depend on the oceans for employment. Healthy marine ecosystems are the foundation for all of this activity, while providing important habitat for the abundant marine life that makes Canada home.
