### Layer attribution

All layers were cropped and re-projected to Canada Polar Stereographic projection (EPSG 5937)

### Notes

#### Bathymetry

Baythmetry is the study of depth of water. On the basemap, contour lines depict different levels of ocean depth to highlight the underwater terrain. Understanding the physical change of water depths helps give insight into the ecological, hydrological and geological differences in the ocean.

#### Sea ice

Sea ice is constantly changing with variations occurring daily. The National Snow & Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) uses satellite imagery to monitor the daily, monthly, and yearly patterns of sea ice changes. For the purpose of this map, a minimum median sea ice extent for September 2015 was used. The use of this layer is for visualization and should not be interpreted as consistent sea ice coverage. For more information on sea ice and to download data, visit [nsidc.org](https://nsidc.org). For better visual representation the layer was smoothed using the Chaikin smoothing algorithm.
