# Ocean planning

##### Ocean planning, also known as marine spatial planning, means thinking about our oceans in three-dimensional zones and co-ordinating multiple uses to ensure that humans get the access needed for various activities without compromising the health of marine ecosystems and species. Ocean planning is also generally defined as a public process through which multiple groups of ocean users come together to discuss the allocation of ocean space for various activities for the long term.

## Why do we need ocean planning?

*In Canada, our oceans are used by everyone – wildlife, industry and communities – and **a healthy ocean is essential** to all their activities. In some areas all three of these groups live, work and play in the same ocean space, creating the potential for conflict that can diminish benefits to all three.*

## Understanding needs and activities

*Ocean planning helps us understand how these groups use the same ocean space, how those uses overlap, and how their activities are best managed together. Planning helps us manage resources and prevent conflicts so that people and nature can thrive together, with benefits for all.*

## Planning for multiple uses

## A continuous and adaptive process

*The plans that result from effective ocean planning can be adapted to changing circumstances, for example the effects of climate change or the emergence of a new ocean industry. Importantly, these ocean plans must be implemented by the appropriate authorities, and the various components and activities of the plan must be monitored and managed over the long term.*
