## Under threat  

No part of the ocean today is unaffected by human activity. 

With the increased use of our ocean and its resources, scientists have noted alarming trends have begun to emerge. The ocean is becoming impoverished from overfishing and pollution. Climate change is warming and acidifying our waters faster than marine wildlife can adapt. 

In Canada, our oceans are used by everyone – wildlife, industry and communities – and a healthy ocean is essential to their activities. In some areas all three of these groups live, work and play in the same ocean space, creating the potential for conflict that can diminish benefits to all three.
