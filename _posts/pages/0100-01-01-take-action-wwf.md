## Conserving Canada's oceans

WWF-Canada is delivering science-driven solutions so ocean ecosystems recover, remain productive and resilient, and improve the well-being of communities. Ocean planning brings those who care about our oceans and rely on them to live, work and play together to keep these vitally important ecosystems healthy and productive. It is integral to WWF-Canada’s work on marine protected areas, marine species and habitat-friendly renewable energy.

#### Higher standards for marine planning and protection

Canada has committed to protect at least 10 per cent of our marine territory by 2020. Currently, only 1 per cent is protected. WWF-Canada is working with a variety of partners to establish a well-planned network of marine protected areas with high ecological standards.

#### Low-impact fisheries for community prosperity

Overfishing is the single biggest threat to our oceans. For a decade, WWF-Canada has partnered with fisheries on sustainable practices, so marine ecosystems and coastal livelihoods can thrive. This work includes campaigns for increasing forage fish (i.e. food for whales, fish and other marine wildlife) and rebuilding Northern cod stocks. We will continue this work, based on ambitious targets that will make a difference on all of Canada’s coasts.

#### New sources of habitat-friendly renewable energy

Energy opportunities abound in Canada’s oceans, such as the Bay of Fundy, where the world’s highest tides offer great potential for tidal power. WWF-Canada is helping chart a sustainable course, working with government and industries to develop low-impact renewable energy projects.
