Canada has the longest coastline and one of the largest ocean estates in the world. Our marine ecosystems are rich in biodiversity and resources, providing benefits to all Canadians. Often the needs of nature, communities and industry compete, decreasing these benefits. Ocean planning can help us manage and prevent conflict so that people and nature can thrive together. This site highlights habitat for important marine species, conservation designations and industrial activity that could affect ocean health. Explore our oceans, and create your own customized maps.
