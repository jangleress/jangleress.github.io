Canadaâ€™s Arctic is home to Inuit and Inuvialuit, remarkable species like narwhal, and special areas known for biodiversity, including the North Water polynya which provides a winter refuge for many Arctic animals. The Northwest Passage is of particular concern as increased use for shipping could have profound effects on this fragile ecosystem.
