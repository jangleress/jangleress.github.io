Canadaâ€™s Atlantic coast and maritime provinces are surrounded by productive waters that support valuable fisheries and are home to the most endangered large marine animals on the planet. Several industries intersect here, including fisheries, tourism and renewable energy, while the St. Lawrence Seaway connects Canadian trade and industry with the rest of the world.
