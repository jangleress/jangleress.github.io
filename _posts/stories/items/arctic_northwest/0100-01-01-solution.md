Shipping through the Northwest Passage is slowly beginning to grow, giving Arctic nations, other governments and industry the opportunity to proactively develop best practices. Best practices can include mapping ecologically significant areas and designating the most vulnerable, providing industry with clear areas to avoid. Other measures include speed limits to reduce underwater noise pollution, regulations requiring the use of lesser polluting fuels with lower spill impacts, and the creation of protected areas in which industrial activities are more carefully planned and managed.
