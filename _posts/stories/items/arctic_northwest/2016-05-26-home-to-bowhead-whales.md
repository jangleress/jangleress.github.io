Every summer, 6,500 bowhead whales migrate through the eastern gateway of the Northwest Passage, and 90 per cent of all bowheads spend their summer in Canadian waters. These whales are highly adapted to life in the Arctic, using their large bow-shaped heads to break through ice as thick as 20 centimetres.
