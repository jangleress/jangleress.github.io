fact: Sea ice decrease has been estimated at 13.3% per decade
---

Historically, shipping through the Arctic has been hazardous, aggravated by the year-round presence of sea ice. Sea ice decrease has been estimated at 13.3 per cent per decade as measured by September minimums. Sea ice loss will only intensify in coming years, and by 2050 summer sea ice might only exist on the northern coasts of Greenland and Canada, an area known as the Last Ice Area.  The Northwest Passage is a short and direct route connecting Asia and Europe, creating economic opportunity but also increasing pressure on the already fragile Arctic environment.
