A polynya is an area of open water surrounded by ice that remains ice-free during the Arctic winter. Many Arctic animals are attuned to the dynamics of the North Water polynya and have come to rely on it as a winter refuge, but changing ice conditions could affect polynya formation in the future. There is also the possibility of industrial development, including fishing, shipping, tourism, and oil and gas.
