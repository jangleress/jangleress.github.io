The combined pressures of climate change and these new development possibilities have prompted the creation of the Pikialarsorsuaq Commission. Led by the Inuit Circumpolar Council, the international commission brings together Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit to protect and manage the North Water polynya so that this extraordinary and pristine place can continue to sustain people and wildlife now and in the future.
