  A blueprint is needed to minimize potential conflicts and keep marine
  ecosystems healthy
---

Managing multiple users in the Bay of Fundy requires an integrated approach that takes into consideration all natural and industrial needs. A blueprint is needed so that when new industries, like tidal energy, are introduced, there is clarity on how to incorporate them to minimize potential conflicts with other industries, marine species and their habitats. This will ensure continued community prosperity from fisheries and new industries, supported by a healthy ecosystem.
