  Species protection and industrial activity are possible in the same ocean

The St. Lawrence belugas are known to have preferred habitats throughout their yearly migration, and their main summer habitat is now protected as part of the St. Lawrence-Saguenay Marine Park. Ships can still transit through the park but are subject to voluntary measures, like slower speeds to decrease the risk of collision with whales. These measures were developed in a collaboration between government, industry and other interested stakeholders, demonstrating that species protection and industrial activity are possible in the same ocean space.
