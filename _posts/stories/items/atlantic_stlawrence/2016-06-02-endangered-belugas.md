Decimated by nearly a century of hunting, the St. Lawrence belugas are currently endangered with a population that is one-tenth its original size, showing little signs of recovery. The cause of the beluga decline is not fully understood, but recovery will likely mean solutions that take into account the multitude of threats, including reduced sources of food (primarily fish like cod and capelin), contamination and habitat loss.
