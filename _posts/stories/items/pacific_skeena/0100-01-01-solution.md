  Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast brings together the
  provincial government and 17 First Nations
---

The communities and First Nations of the Skeena and B.C. North Coast are deeply concerned for the ecosystem and are active in its protection. The Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast brings together the provincial government and 17 First Nations. They have developed blueprints for sustainable use of the B.C. coast, and designated the estuary and eelgrass beds as areas to be protected in the face of increasing development.
