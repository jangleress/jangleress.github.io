Eelgrass beds in the estuary are one of the defining features of the region. This underwater plant provides critical habitat and food, and is a nursery for many important species. Up to 80 per cent of commercially important fish species rely on eelgrass beds during some part of at least one stage of their lifecycle, including the hundreds of millions of salmon that migrate through these eelgrass beds every year.
