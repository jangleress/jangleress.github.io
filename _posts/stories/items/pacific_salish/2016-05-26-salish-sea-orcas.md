fact: Salish Sea resident orcas are considered endangered
---
With a population estimated at less than 80 adults, the Salish Sea resident orcas are classified as endangered in both Canada and the U.S. They are threatened by habitat loss, a reduction of their preferred food source (Chinook salmon), disturbance and underwater noise pollution.
