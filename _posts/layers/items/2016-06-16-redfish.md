Sometimes called ocean perch, redfish actually belong to the scorpion fish family. These spiny fish live in rocky areas of the north Atlantic, and can grow to lengths of 70 centimetres. True to their name, adults are bright red or bright orange in colour. 

There are several redfish stocks off the coast of Newfoundland. Science and management of these stocks is conducted by both Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, depending on the location of the stock, given the fact the one stock straddles Canada’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and another stock is fished outside the EEZ.

The Newfoundland fisheries data is displayed in 20 km by 20 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total weight (kg) caught between 2008 and 2011. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
