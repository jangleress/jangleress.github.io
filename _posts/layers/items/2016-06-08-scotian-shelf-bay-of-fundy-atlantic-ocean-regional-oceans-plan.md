In the Maritime region, Fisheries and Oceans Canada developed a regional oceans plan that covers the Bay of Fundy, Atlantic Coast and Scotian Shelf. Its aim is to provide a plan that integrates the different regions of the Maritimes as well as the needs of current and future users, and maintains healthy marine ecosystems, sustainable communities and responsible use through integrated management.
