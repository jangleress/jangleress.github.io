Designated and administered by Environment Canada, a marine National Wildlife Area (mNWA) is a type of marine protected area that aims for long-term protection of wildlife and its habitat. In order to be designated as an mNWA, the area must support a nationally significant number of migratory birds, species at risk and their habitat, or be a rare or unusual habitat or region.

There are no designated marine National Wildlife Areas in Canada. Currently one site has been proposed for designation: Scott Islands, in the Pacific Ocean.
