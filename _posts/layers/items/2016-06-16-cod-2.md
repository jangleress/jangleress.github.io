Atlantic cod are one of the many species of cod found throughout Canadian waters in the Arctic and the Atlantic. Atlantic cod have a streamlined body and varied coloration including red, black and brown. Their length can vary between 60 to 70 centimetres and on average they weigh between 2 to 3 kilograms. 

The Atlantic cod fishery on Canada’s east coast once supported one of the most lucrative fisheries in Canada. Mismanagement and overfishing led to a collapse of the stock in the 1990s and a fishing moratorium in Newfoundland and Quebec. Today, cod is fished in a few Atlantic provinces, but at much lower volumes. 

In 1997, an inshore cod fishery was reopened in Newfoundland, although the moratorium remains in place for the rest of the Newfoundland. In 2016, the inshore cod fishery, also known as 3Ps cod, was certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council.

The Newfoundland fisheries data is displayed in 20 km by 20 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total weight (kg) caught between 2008 and 2011. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
