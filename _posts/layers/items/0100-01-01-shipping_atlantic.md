Shipping in Canada’s Atlantic ocean connects global trade to the cities and industries on the Great Lakes via the St. Lawrence seaway, while container ships and oil tankers are prevalent at the ports of St. John’s, Halifax and St. John. 

Globally, massive numbers of fishing, freight and cruise ships traverse the world’s oceans. The widespread use of shipping benefits both global and local economies, but the impacts on the marine environment can be significant. 

Marine planners have at their disposal many strategies to mitigate the impacts of shipping, including area-based solutions such as ensuring that shipping lanes avoid critical habitat.

The Atlantic shipping layer displays the number of vessels in 2 arc-minute by 2 arc-minute grid cells from March 2010 to Feb 2011. Any grid cell with less than 25 vessels in 2010 was omitted for visualization.
