Designated and managed by Parks Canada, National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) conserve and protect representative examples of Canada’s natural and cultural marine heritage. In contrast to other protected areas, mining and oil and gas activities are not allowed inside an NMCA. Parks Canada is required to provide opportunities for public education and enjoyment through the protected areas it creates.

Both designated and proposed National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are shown in the map layer. While the Lancaster Sound and Southern Strait of Georgia proposed NMCAs have clear boundaries, the Îles-de-la-Madeleine boundary has not yet been defined by Parks Canada. The Îles-de-la-Madeleine polygon on the map is only used to highlight the study area.
