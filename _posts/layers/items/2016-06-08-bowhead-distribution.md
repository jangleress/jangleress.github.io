The bowhead whale is found throughout Canada’s Arctic. Fully 90 per cent of all bowheads spend their summer in Canadian waters. They are highly adapted to life in the Arctic, using their large bow-shaped heads to break through ice as thick as 20 centimetres. 

Although healthy today, the bowhead populations are listed as being of “special concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act. Threats like climate change could affect their population status in the future.

Bowheads are critical for marine ecosystems. Thriving whale populations are indicators of healthy oceans. When human activity degrades ocean ecosystems, whale populations are often severely affected.
