The Marine Plan Partnership for the North Pacific Coast (MaPP) consists of the province of British Columbia and 17 First Nations. The planning area spans more than 102 square kilometres on the B.C. North Coast, and within it there are four sub-regions for which the Partnership has developed marine plans. Through these plans, MaPP has identified areas for different activities, such as tourism and recreation, renewable energy and shellfish aquaculture, as well as areas that need stronger protection to maintain healthy, vibrant ecosystems.
