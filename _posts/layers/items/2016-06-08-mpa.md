Under the _Oceans Act_, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is charged with designating Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and developing a network of MPAs. Using the 13 bioregions as a geographic framework, MPAs are defined areas of the ocean where key fish and marine mammals, endangered or threatened marine species, unique habitats and areas of high biological productivity or biodiversity are conserved and protected. Activities allowed within an MPA depend on the objectives of the area (what’s being protected) and what is compatible with those objectives, and can also be spatially or seasonally limited.
