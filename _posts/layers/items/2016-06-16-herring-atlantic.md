Atlantic herring are a small silvery fish, weighing up to 750 grams, and are found throughout Atlantic Canada. Herring are fished for both food and bait in eight designated fishing areas across Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. 

As forage fish, Atlantic herring are an important source of food for harbour porpoises, dolphins, whales, sharks and the critically endangered Bluefin tuna. Forage fish form the backbone of many marine ecosystems and play a vital role in the marine food chain.

The Maritimes fisheries data is displayed in 2 minute by 2 minute grid cells. The fisheries landings are a sum of caught weight (kg) between 2010 and 2014. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
