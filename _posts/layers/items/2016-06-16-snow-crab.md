Snow crab are a flat-bodied crustacean with five pairs of spider-like legs. Within a population, individual snow crabs vary in size, and males are twice as large as females. Snow crab prefer deep, cold-water habitats in the north Atlantic ocean and are mainly found in the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Scotian and Newfoundland and Labrador continental shelves. 

The snow crab fishery is amongst the most valuable in Canada, and Canada produces two-thirds of the global supply.

The Maritimes fisheries data is displayed in 2 minute by 2 minute grid cells. The fisheries landings are a sum of caught weight (kg) between 2010 and 2014. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
