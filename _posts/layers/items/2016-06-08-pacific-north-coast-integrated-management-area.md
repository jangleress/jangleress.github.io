The Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area (PNCIMA) was one of the five large ocean management areas managed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada to pilot Integrated Oceans Management. PNCIMA was a collaborative process that included federal, provincial, First Nations and other stakeholders. These groups worked together to study the PNCIMA region and develop a management plan that integrated the needs of nature, industry and communities.
