Fishing is an important way of life for Indigenous peoples living in the Arctic. Communities in the North rely on traditional knowledge and known areas of abundance for fishing harvest. 

Community consultations have helped identify the important fishing areas, areas of known abundance and potential commercial fishing sites for the two most abundant species, Arctic char and Arctic cod. 

Arctic char live in both marine and freshwater habitats in Canada. They are generally found in Arctic waters, but are also commonly found near Quebec and Labrador. During the spawning season, Arctic char can be recognized by their bright orange colour. 

Arctic cod are smaller than other cod found in Canadian waters and can be distinguished by their v-shaped tails and protruding lower jaws. These cod prefer very cold waters and can usually be found across the Canadian Arctic all the way to the Grand Banks.
