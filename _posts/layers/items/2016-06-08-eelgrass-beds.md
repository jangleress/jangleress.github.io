Eelgrass beds are found throughout B.C. coastal waters. This critical underwater plant provides habitat and food, and is a nursery for many important species. Fully 80 per cent of commercially important fish species rely on eelgrass beds during some part of their life cycle, like the hundreds of millions of Pacific salmon that migrate through these eelgrass beds every year.
