A polynya is an area of open water surrounded by ice. Many polynyas remain ice-free even during the Arctic winter. Polynyas are areas of higher productivity and are vital for Arctic birds and mammals as areas for feeding, reproduction and migration. 

The North Water polynya, located between Canada and Greenland, is one of the most productive ecosystems in the Arctic. It is also the largest polynya in the Arctic, measuring 80,000 square kilometres at its maximum extent. This polynya is called Pikialarsorsuaq in Greenlandic, which means “great upwelling” and refers to the abundance of nutrients that have made the polynya critically important to Arctic whales and helped sustain Inuit for millennia.

The polynya layer was created using MODIS satellite images from the period of July 2002 to July 2013. Polynyas were identified as areas that have a probability of open water greater than 20 per cent during the week beginning May 5.
