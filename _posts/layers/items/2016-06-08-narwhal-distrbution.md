Narwhals, often called the unicorn of the sea, are famous for the long ivory tusk that spirals counter-clockwise up to 9 feet from the head of adult males. Residing primarily in Canada’s Western Arctic, 75 per cent of the world’s narwhal population summers in Canada. 

Although healthy today, narwhals are listed as being of “special concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act. Threats like increasing development in the Arctic could affect their population status in the future.

When human activities negatively impact the marine environment, key species like narwhal are also often impacted. Healthy narwhal populations are a vital part of a thriving Arctic ecosystem, and incorporating our knowledge of where these whales live into ocean planning will help us ensure we account for their importance as development pressures increase.
