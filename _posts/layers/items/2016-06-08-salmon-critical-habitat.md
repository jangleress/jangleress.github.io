Salmon are a keystone species and indicators of healthy rivers and oceans. Wild Atlantic salmon are found only on Canada’s east coast. Many Atlantic salmon populations are at risk due to a multitude of threats. Some, like the endangered Inner Bay of Fundy population, have decreased by 90 per cent in recent years. 

Salmon are an anadromous fish species, requiring both freshwater and marine habitats throughout their life cycle. Many rivers that feed into the Inner Bay of Fundy are used by the salmon, including 10 that are identified as critical habitat. These rivers contain features such as riffles, runs and pools that facilitate feeding, spawning, rearing, migration and overwintering. Currently, not enough is known about Atlantic salmon marine habitat requirements.
