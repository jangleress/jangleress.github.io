The white beluga whales, with their smiling upturned mouths, are extremely social mammals that live, hunt and migrate together in pods, ranging from a few individuals to hundreds of whales. Called the “canary of the sea,” belugas use a series of chirps, clicks, whistles and squeals for communication. 

They are found throughout the Canadian Arctic and as far south as the St. Lawrence estuary, with 70 per cent of the global population spending their summers in Canada. As top predators, belugas have a special role to play in our marine ecosystems, and the state of their health as a species also indicates the overall health of the ocean in which they live.
