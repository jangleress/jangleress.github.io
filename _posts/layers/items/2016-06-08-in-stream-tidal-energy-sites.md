The Bay of Fundy with its famous tides is one of the most promising and feasible sites for tidal energy generation in Canada. Studies in the bay have identified the Minas Basin as one of the areas with the most potential for renewable energy generation.

Waves, tides and offshore wind are all potential sources of marine renewables with possible sites on each of Canada’s coasts. Marine renewables are a new economic opportunity that can create jobs and provide a source of clean energy to help Canada transition to more sustainable forms of energy production. Installation of underwater power cables in the Minas Basin began in 2014, and the Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy (FORCE) plans to place the first turbines in 2016, making it one of the first test centres in the world.

Marine planning can be used to help determine the best areas for these projects, including finding sites best suited for energy production without interfering with wildlife, natural processes and other industries.

This layer shows the area where the FORCE test site for in-stream tidal energy is located, and also where three small-scale projects are being developed.
