Striped bass are long spiny fish found in Atlantic Canada with distinct populations in the Bay of Fundy and the St. Lawrence River and estuary. They are an important link in the food chain; thriving populations of striped bass are indicative of healthy rivers and estuaries. 

Striped bass once supported a commercial and recreational fishery, but overfishing and habitat degradation led to the fish becoming locally extinct, or “expirated,” from the St. Lawrence.  A reintroduction program run by the federal government and the province of Quebec has been successful in returning a small striped bass population to the St. Lawrence River and estuary. 

Since reintroduction, critical habitats for spawning, incubation and larval development remain unknown, but a small portion of the estuary has been designated as critical habitat due to high concentrations of juveniles from the beginning of September to the end of October each year.
