Named after the distinctive hump in front of their small dorsal fin, humpback whales are famous for their singing ability. Humpback songs appear to be shared by all singing members in the same area of the ocean: as the song changes, all members sing the new song. The same song is sung in spite of the great distance between groups in the population (up to 5,000 kilometres). 

In waters off B.C., humpback whale numbers are growing but have not yet regained their historical abundances. Humpbacks are currently identified as “threatened” and face many obstacles to recovery, including being at high risk of ship strikes.

Humpback critical habitat in the Pacific are areas where the whale often forages and feeds. The identified areas also provide the space and disturbance-free environment that humpbacks require for resting and socializing. Critical habitat is designated for species when their population is endangered or at risk of becoming endangered in the future. 

Just like other large marine mammals, humpbacks are critical for marine ecosystems, and the state of their health as a species reflects the state of health for oceans in which they live. Human activity can severely affect whale populations, and ocean planning is a tool that allows us to take these species and their habitats into consideration when making decisions about using our ocean spaces.
