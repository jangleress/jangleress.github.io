Sea scallops in Canada’s Atlantic can grow up to 20 centimetres wide, earning them their alternate name of giant scallops. Sea scallops feed on plankton, filtering their food from the waters around them. These bivalve molluscs are fished in inshore and offshore waters from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland. They live in sandy or gravel sea beds to depths of up to almost 400 metres, but fishing activity takes place in shallower water. 

Sea scallops are an economically important commercial fishery, with much of the catch exported to other countries. In 2010, the Eastern Canada offshore sea scallop fishery was the first scallop fishery in North America to receive eco-certification under the Marine Stewardship Council.

The Newfoundland fisheries data is displayed in 20 km by 20 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total weight (kg) caught between 2008 and 2011. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
