The American lobster is one of the largest marine crustaceans. It is also one of the longest living marine crustaceans, with lifespans of up to 50 years. The lobster is found throughout the Northwest Atlantic, but the largest populations and fisheries are found in the Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, Gulf of St. Lawrence and the coast of Nova Scotia. 

The American lobster fishery is one of the most lucrative fisheries and most valuable seafood exports in Canada. There are 45 lobster fishing areas in the Maritime provinces and lobster landings have been on the rise since the 1980s. This fishery has one of the longest history of regulations, which has helped ensure the health of the lobster population and fishery.

The Maritimes fisheries data is displayed in 2 minute by 2 minute grid cells. The fisheries landings are a sum of caught weight (kg) between 2010 and 2014. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
