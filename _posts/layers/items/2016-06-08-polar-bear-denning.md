The largest bear in the world and the Arctic’s top wildlife predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. About two-thirds of the world’s polar bears live in Canadian territory. 

As a top predator, polar bears can signal problems in the Arctic marine ecosystem. Polar bears are highly respected within Inuit culture, traditions and lore, and are valued as an important source of food, skins and livelihood for skilled Inuit hunters.
