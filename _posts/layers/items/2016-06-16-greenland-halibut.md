Closely related to Atlantic halibut, Greenland halibut prefer colder waters and are usually lighter in colour and much smaller in size. Significant populations are found in the Grand Banks, as well as in the deep waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but the species makes its home throughout Canada’s Atlantic waters, from Greenland to the U.S. border. Just like their Atlantic cousins, these fish are flat, with both eyes on the right side of their body, leaving the left side completely blind. 

Greenland halibut is also often called Greenland turbot, and in 2014 they were the most valuable commercial groundfish in Atlantic Canada, with the vast majority of the activity taking place in the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Newfoundland fisheries data is displayed in 20 km by 20 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total weight (kg) caught between 2008 and 2011. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
