Canada’s busiest port, Port Metro Vancouver, is located on the Pacific Coast. Shipping in the Pacific is expected to increase, with many port expansions in various stages of development, and much of the new traffic is expected to go to the relatively quiet waters of the North Coast to the port of Prince Rupert.

While the widespread use of shipping benefits both global and local economies, the harmful effects on the marine environment can be numerous. 

Marine planning can be used to mitigate these effects, for example by designating shipping lanes that don’t travel through critical habitats or designating areas where slower ship speeds are required to reduce noise pollution.

The Pacific shipping layer displays the vessel traffic (in hours) in 2010 in 5 km by 5 km grid cells. Any grid cell with less than three hours of shipping traffic for the year was omitted for visualization. All vessel types were included.
