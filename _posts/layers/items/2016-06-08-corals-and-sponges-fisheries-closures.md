Cold-water corals and sponges, found in the deep waters off all three Canadian coasts, form complex and varied habitat that allows a wide diversity of marine wildlife to flourish. They are often associated with increased biodiversity and are important spawning and nursery grounds for many fish. Due to their fragile construction, cold-water corals and sponges are extremely vulnerable to physical disturbances, especially from fishing gear used on or near the seabed.

Fisheries closures are a tool used by managers to protect an ecosystem and its resources, including cold-water corals and sponges. A closure can be put in place to preserve sensitive habitats or to allow a fish stock time to replenish. They are limited to specific areas, fish species, and/or fishing gear. Fisheries closures can be put into place by government, or can be voluntarily adopted by the fishing community.

The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) also creates fisheries closures, mainly for areas outside of the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone. These NAFO closures seek to protect "vulnerable marine ecosystems" from fishing gear that disturbs the seabed, for example in areas where cold-water corals and sponges are found. NAFO is an intergovernmental fishery science and management organization that aims to conserve and sustainably use the fishery resources of the northwest Atlantic.
