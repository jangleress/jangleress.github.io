The people and wildlife of Canadaâ€™s North are highly dependent on Arctic sea ice, and warming temperatures are causing drastic declines. Projections of future sea ice loss indicate that in 2050 only a fringe of ice will remain in Northern Canada and Greenland, called the Last Ice Area. In the future, the Last Ice Area will be the only part of the Arctic that can support the critical activities of polar bears, seals, birds and many other Arctic species.

The Last Ice Area layer seen on the map was developed by WWF's Arctic Programme. It was created using the future climate change projection scenario of RCP 4.5 defined by the Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change. (CCSM4 model output prepared for CMIP5; NCAR 2012)
