B.C.’s crab fishery is the second most economically valuable in the province, after salmon. Four species of crab are harvested commercially, including Dungeness crab, Red Rock crab, Golden King crab, and Red King crab. Of the four species, Dungeness crab is the most important, not just for the commercial fishery, but also for recreational and First Nations uses.

Dungeness crabs prefer sandy areas for their habitat, and they can weigh up to 2 kilograms with purple-brown shells that can grow to more than 20 centimetres wide. They are harvested across B.C. waters, but can be found up and down the Pacific coast from Southern Alaska to California.

The Pacific Coast Dungeness crab fisheries data is shown in 4 km by 4 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total catch weight (kg) between 2005 and 2009. Data was privacy screened each year so that cells with less than four fishing vessels were given a 0 kg value for that given year. Data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks.
