Currently, there are few large-scale industrial projects in the Skeena River estuary. The government of British Columbia is planning an expansion of the province’s liquid natural gas sector, with several proposed projects for the Skeena region. New industrial users on the Skeena can have a profound effect on the community and wildlife of the estuary. They can lead to increased pollution and shipping activity, and can interfere with important habitats, especially salmon migration routes.
