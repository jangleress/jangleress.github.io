The blue whale is the largest mammal to have ever existed: up to 30 metres long and 200 tonnes in weight. Blue whales are also extremely loud, producing sounds that reach the same noise level as a jet engine. Found in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the blue whale is endangered and faces myriad threats to recovery, including contamination, noise pollution and decreased food availability.

Blue whales are an important component of marine ecosystems, and when human activity degrades the health of those ecosystems, blue whale populations often suffer as a result. Ocean planning can help us to make sure that blue whales and humans both thrive into the future.
