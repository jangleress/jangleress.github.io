The Northern bottlenose whale is currently only found in the North Atlantic ocean and is easily identifiable by its bulbous head and prominent beak. Bottlenose whales reside in areas of deep water and are extraordinary divers, reaching depths of up to 1,500 metres. 

The population today is endangered, nearly wiped out by historical hunting. Recovery today is impeded by human disturbances, decrease in food availability, contaminants, entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes.  

Preferring areas of deep water, the bottlenose whale critical habitat includes three underwater canyons on the Scotian Shelf: the Gully, Shortland Canyon and the Haldimand Canyon. These deep water areas provide the whale with abundant foraging opportunities, and areas for socializing, communicating, mating and raising their young.
