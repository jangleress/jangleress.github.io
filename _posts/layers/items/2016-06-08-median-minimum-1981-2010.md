Sea ice is the foundation of life in the Arctic. Communities and wildlife are highly evolved and attuned to life in an ice-dominated ecosystem. Polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform to hunt on and Inuit use the ice for transportation and hunting. Climate change has caused drastic changes, and loss of sea ice has been estimated at 13.3 per cent per decade as measured by September minimums. The nine lowest September sea ice minimums have occurred in the last nine years, and in February 2016 a new record low for winter sea ice was recorded.

Four sea ice layers are available on this map. The two median sea ice layers depict the median conditions over a 30-year period (1981-2010). The 2015 minimum and maximum extents can be compared to the minimum median and maximum sea ice layers respectively.
