The Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) is managed by the Beaufort Sea Partnership, a collaboration between the Inuvialuit and federal, Aboriginal and territorial governments. The Partnership is in charge of managing the ISR which includes 1.1 million square kilometres of the Beaufort Sea and coast. The work of the Partnership has led to the  development of a management plan for the region, as well as other plans for species important to the ecosystem and Inuvialuit, like the beluga whale.
