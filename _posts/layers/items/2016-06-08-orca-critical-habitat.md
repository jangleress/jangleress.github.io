Orcas are easily recognized by their black skin with distinctive patches of white. One of the shrewdest predators in the ocean, they are often called the “wolves of the sea.” Orcas are able to communicate through whistles, squeaks and whines created with air trapped in their blowhole. 

Some orcas are able to use clicking sounds as a form of echolocation, allowing them to differentiate between species of salmon in order to feed on the more nutritious Chinook salmon. As with other top predators, strong orca populations are indicators of abundant food and healthy marine ecosystems overall.

The extremely low population of approximately 80 adult individuals puts the Salish Sea resident orca population at high risk of extinction. Main threats to this population are the lack of prey, the introduction and increase of toxins, physical and acoustic disturbance, and the degradation of critical habitat.

Their critical habitat includes areas of consistent and prolonged use, and also corresponds to areas of salmon migration where the whales have important opportunities to feed. Critical habitat is designated to protect places key to the survival of a particular species, when their population is recognized as endangered or at risk of becoming so. When human activity degrades critical habitat, the species who rely on that habitat to survive are often severely affected.
