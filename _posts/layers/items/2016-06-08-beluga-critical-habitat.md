The white beluga whales, with their smiling upturned mouths, are extremely social mammals that live, hunt and migrate together in pods, ranging from a few individuals to hundreds of whales. Called the “canary of the sea,” belugas use a series of chirps, clicks, whistles and squeals for communication. 

They are found throughout the Canadian Arctic and as far south as the St. Lawrence estuary, with 70 per cent of the global population spending their summers in Canada. As top predators, belugas have a special role to play in our marine ecosystems, and the state of their health as a species also indicates the overall health of the ocean in which they live.

The St. Lawrence belugas are considered “threatened” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act, meaning they are likely to become endangered if no actions are taken to aid recovery.

Many marine species have specific requirements of the places in which they live, feed or reproduce, and often return to the same places every year for these activities. When a species’ population is endangered or at risk of becoming so, a critical habitat is designated in order to protect places important to their survival.

For the beluga, their critical habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence includes those areas used for birthing and rearing of baby belugas. Other areas correspond to nutrient-rich waters where the belugas go to feed.
