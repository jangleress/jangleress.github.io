After the ratification of the Nunavut Land Claims agreement, a Nunavut Planning Commission was created. The Commission’s mandate is to develop, implement and monitor land use planning in the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA), which spans more than 350,000 square kilometres of the Canadian Arctic.  Because the NSA boasts a relatively pristine environment and many development opportunities, the Commission has drafted a Nunavut Land Use Plan with land use designations, and clearly identified areas for management and protection.
