The Government of Canada divided Canada’s ocean territory and Great Lakes into 13 different regions, called “bioregions.” These bioregions provide the spatial framework for establishing a national network of marine protected areas in Canada. Each bioregion was defined based on common oceanographic and bathymetric features, so that together all 13 are representative of the diversity found on Canada’s three coasts and Great Lakes.
