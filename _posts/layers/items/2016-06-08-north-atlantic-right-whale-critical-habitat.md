The North Atlantic right whale is endangered, with a population of approximately only 450 individuals. The biggest risks to right whales are ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. For example, 70 per cent of right whales in the Atlantic show evidence of injury from being entangled in fishing gear. When right whale populations in Canadian waters are thriving, it’s an indication of an abundant food supply and a healthy ocean overall.

Because right whales have been identified as endangered, important areas where they live, feed or reproduce have been designated as critical habitat in order to help them survive. 

Right whales have high energy demands and require lots of food. Their critical habitats are nutrient-rich areas with high concentrations of their preferred food sources: copepods and zooplankton. Ocean planning can make sure that these important places in the marine ecosystem are taken into account when managing human activities that could negatively impact right whales.
