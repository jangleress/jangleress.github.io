Sea ice loss is slowly opening the Arctic to more shipping. Ship transits are projected to double by 2020, and in the Lancaster Sound region mining activity alone will increase transits from a baseline of a few ships a year to nearly one transit every two days in the summer months.

Marine planning can be used to mitigate the detrimental effects of increased fishing, freight and cruise ship travel on marine environments. Two measures include designated shipping lanes that avoid critical habitats and designated areas for slower ship speeds to reduce noise pollution. 

The Arctic shipping routes are displayed as routes for each vessel in 2013. All ship types are shown, including tankers, research vessels and passenger vessels.
