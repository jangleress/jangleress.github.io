These dark greenish-brown groundfish have both eyes on the right side of their body and a mouthful of sharp teeth. Atlantic halibut are wide and flat, growing up to two metres long. These fish are found throughout the north Atlantic, and large numbers live in the waters off of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Greenland, as well as in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It’s an economically important commercial fishery in Atlantic Canada, and in 2014 it was the second most valuable groundfish species for the region. The Atlantic halibut is closely related to Greenland halibut, also fished commercially in Atlantic Canada.

The Newfoundland fisheries data is displayed in 20 km by 20 km grid cells. The information has been summed per grid cell to show the total weight (kg) caught between 2008 and 2011. The data is visualized using a quantile classification with five breaks and is privacy screened to exclude any NAFO subarea with fewer than five fishers or vessels.
