Ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) are special areas that serve an important function, like supporting the health of an ecosystem. EBSAs are identified through a scientific process that takes local and traditional knowledge into account, which ensures that both ecologically and culturally important areas are recognized. When compiled, EBSAs are a tool available to planners to identify important areas.
