Just like on land, beneath the ocean floor there are reserves of oil and gas that can be extracted and used for energy production. Canada’s three coasts are varied in their approach to oil and gas exploration and production. 

In British Columbia, an exploration moratorium exists on the North Coast to protect the wild and healthy ocean space. In the Arctic, the Beaufort Sea contains two-thirds of Canada’s oil and gas reserves but little exploration and no production has occurred due to the difficulty of operating in the harsh Arctic environment. In contrast, active wells can be found in Canada’s Atlantic ocean, with others slated to begin production over the next few years.
