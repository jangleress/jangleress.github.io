The Pacific salmon fishery is the most valuable in British Columbia. In total, six species of salmon are fished throughout the entirety of the B.C. coast and its rivers. Just three rivers – Skeena, Nass and Fraser – account for 75 per cent of total Pacific salmon numbers in Canada.

The six species found in B.C. vary in their appearance as well as habitat and food requirements, but all make use of both marine and freshwater environments throughout their lifecycle. Salmon are a key link in the marine and estuary food chain but are also an inextricable part of the B.C. identity and First Nations culture. 

The Pacific coast salmon fisheries data is shown by salmon catch estimate areas (SCEA) between 2003 and 2007. Created by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, SCEAs show catch and effort values based on the many annual openings for commercial fishing. SCEAs change over time based on whether the area is open for a certain gear type. Data was privacy screened so that areas with less than three fishing vessels were given a 0 kg value across the time period. 

The data displayed on the map is an aggregate of five species (Chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye) and three gear types (gillnet, seine and troll). Original data was provided in separate files for each year and each gear type. The cumulative number of species caught was found by aggregating the different years based on SCEA. The different gear types were then summed to the full management area. Data is visualized using a quantile classification system showing the number of salmon per management area.
