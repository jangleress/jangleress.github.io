These small, silver fish are found travelling in schools all over the Northern Pacific ocean, and they migrate closer to the shore for the spawning season. Pacific herring are fished commercially for both bait and for food, including their roe, and are also important to the culture and livelihoods of many B.C. First Nations.

Pacific herring are known as forage fish, meaning that they are a key part of the food chain for other larger species, which include Chinook salmon, Pacific halibut and harbour seals. Managing Pacific herring sustainably means a continued, reliable food supply for the benefit of people and nature.

Roe herring catch (metric tonnes) is shown for the period between 1989 and 2008. The spatial areas shown on the map represent commercial fisheries openings for roe herring. The data is aggregated to show total roe herring catch for all gear types (gillnet and seine). The data was summed to the full management area. 

Data was privacy screened each year to filter areas with less than three four fishing vessels. However, for time periods of incomplete licensing information, it was assumed more than three vessels were in the area, and as a result privacy screening did not take place. The data is displayed using a quantile classification system showing the catch weight of roe herring per management area.
