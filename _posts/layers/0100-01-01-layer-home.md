**Ocean Planning** uses maps to create a more comprehensive picture of a marine area - identifying where and how an area is being used and what important marine ecosystem components exist there.

Add map layers from the categories above to visualize different species, activities and planning initiatives in this area. You can also customize your map by drawing new layers. When you are finished, export your map to download and share.
